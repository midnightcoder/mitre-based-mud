# Mire

It's a nonviolent MUD. (Multi-User Dungeon)

## Usage

Install [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) if you
haven't already:

    $ curl -O ~/bin/lein http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/stable/bin/lein
    $ chmod 755 bin/lein

Then do "lein run" inside the Mire directory to launch the Mire
server. Then players can connect by telnetting to port 3333.

## Motivation

This code is not that interesting as a game, though I suppose
something fun could be built using it as a base. The primary purpose
of it is as a demonstration of how to build a simple multithreaded app
in Clojure.

Mire is built up step-by-step, where each step introduces one or two
small yet key Clojure principles and builds on the last step. The
steps each exist in separate git branches. To get the most out of
reading Mire, you should start reading in the branch called
[step-01-echo-server](http://github.com/technomancy/mire/tree/01-echo-server)
and continue from there.

While you can learn from Mire on its own, it has been written
specifically for the [PeepCode screencast on
Clojure](http://peepcode.com/products/functional-programming-with-clojure).
